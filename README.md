## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

**stuartcodd5/stuartcodd5** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hello! My name is StuarT Codd. I'm from Seattle, Washington. I'm currently taking classes in the TripleTen bpotcamp focusing on Business Intelligence. I'm currently learning about Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. I'm looking to collaborate on any projects that require any business analytics work to be done. I'm looking for help on leads to jobs in the business analytics field. Ask me about my background outside of business analytics. 

You can reach me at stucodd@gmail.com or on my LinkedIn.

A fun fact about me is that I take improv classes and have performed live.
